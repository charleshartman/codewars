# You've just finished writing the last chapter for your novel when a virus
# suddenly infects your document. It has swapped the 'i's and 'e's in 'ei' words
# and capitalised random letters. Write a function which will:

# a) remove the spelling errors in 'ei' words. (Example of 'ei' words: their,
# => caffeine, deceive, weight)

# b) only capitalise the first letter of each sentence. Make sure the rest of
# => the sentence is in lower case.

# Example: He haD iEght ShOTs of CAffIEne. => He had eight shots of caffeine.
